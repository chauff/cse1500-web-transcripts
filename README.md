# Web technology course materials

This repository contains the web technology course materials for the CSE1500 Web and Database Technology course at TU Delft. Last updated for the 2021/22 course edition. **There will be no more updates in the future as I am leaving TU Delft and academia.**

The course page can be found at https://chauff.github.io/cse1500-web-transcripts/.

## Contributors

Creating such transcripts is not a job for a single person, but a group effort! All contributors to this repository can be found on the [Contributors](https://github.com/chauff/Web-Teaching/graphs/contributors) tab! 

## Inspired by

The transcript grew initially out of course material derived from the [Learning Web App Development](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-web-app/9781449371388/) book, the [Express documentation](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html), the [HTTP: the definite guide](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/http-the-definitive/1565925092/) book, [The Book of CSS3](https://thebookofcss3.com/) and code samples/examples from the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/). Over the years it has been refined.

# Setup notes

Two Visual Studio Code extensions are important for this setup to remain efficient: [Markdown PDF](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzane.markdown-pdf) (to generate PDFs of the lectures and assignments) and [Markdown All In One](https://github.com/yzhang-gh/vscode-markdown) to automatically create/update table of contents.

The PDFs are no longer available on GitHub (in order to limit the repository's size). They can be generated with the Markdown PDF Visual Studio Code extension.

The transcripts are written in US English.

GitHub Actions workflow: after a manual trigger (head to the Actions tab to trigger) or on a weekly basis, all links are extracted from the Markdown files in this repo (except README.md) and their returned status code is recorded. Anything beyond a status code 400 should be checked. The report resides as artifact on the Actions tab and is called `urlCheck`.
