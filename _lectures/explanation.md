*At times we use ☝️ and 👇 to make it clear whether an explanation belongs to the code snippet above or below the text. The :bangbang: sign is added to code examples you should run yourself. When you see a :bug:, we offer advice on how to debug your code with the browser's and VSC's tooling - these hints are solely to help you with your programming project and not exam material! Lastly, paragraphs or sections with a :cookie: provide a bit of extra information: they are not exam material.*
