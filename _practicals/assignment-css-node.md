# Assignment CSS+Node

In the first part of this assignment, you will employ *CSS* to style your splash and game screens.

In the second part of this assignment, you will implement a number of smaller items, that each do not take a lot of time, but round off your application and showcase additional abilities of Node.js and the browser.

## 0. Preliminaries

Remember that this is a group assignment! Work efficiently as a team! Both team members **must contribute to the code** and **both team members must understand the code**. The group interview will focus on having the required functionality and showing off your understanding of the code.

### Overview of deliverables and upload procedure

| **Task** | **Deliverables**                               |
|:-----|:---------------------------------------------------|
| 1.1  | CSS                                                |
| 1.2  | CSS                                                |
| 1.3  | CSS                                                |
| 1.4  | â†’â†’â†’ upload 1.1 / 1.2 to your thread on Brightspace            |
| 2    | Source code                                        |
| 3    | -                                                  |
| 4 (optional) | â†’â†’â†’ upload URL to your thread on Brightspace         |

This assignment requires you to finalize your application's source code and thus there is **no** PDF to submit.

Submit your code in the form of a zipped folder. Make sure that your code contains the necessary `package.json` file to install/run the code, i.e. it should be sufficient to run `npm install` and `npm start` to start the server. Any specific configuration parameters your code requires should be described in an accompanying `README` file.

*Note: we expect one zipped code submission, we do **not** want one code submission per task!*

The code has to be uploaded by one of the team members to ðŸ’¡ Brightspace under **CSE Web assessment** (find the category your group belongs too) before the assessment session with the teaching assistant and before the ultimate assessment deadline. This means that the outcomes of all web technology assignments are uploaded to the same directory!

**To pass this assignment, you must have employed the necessary CSS and use templating. You pass if your app can deal with players executing the game as intended** (already achieved in the previous assignment) **AND with players trying to make at least some invalid moves**. **You cannot pass this last web assignment without having passed the previous web assignment.** The [rubric](../rubric/) contains example questions for each assignments. During the assessment you can make use of your notes.

## 1. CSS

Now is the time to style your splash and game screens with CSS. Do **not** use external libraries or preprocessing tools.

Style the game so that it looks and works well on a laptop/desktop device, i.e. we are considering screen resolutions of ~1366x768 or higher. We are **not** concerned about apps for mobile devices or responsive designs.

As you might have already guessed, your CSS should reside in `myapp/public/stylesheets`. That folder already contains a `style.css` boilerplate file. In order to keep your code maintainable, you can for instance place all CSS that applies to both the game and splash screens in `style.css` and in addition create separate `splash.css` and `game.css` stylesheets for CSS rules specific to each screen. Note that stylesheets [can contain other stylesheets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@import).

### 1.1)

First, work on your **splash screen** and style the page with CSS according to your design. To ensure that everyone learns the basics of CSS, we provide a list of **must-have** CSS properties. Your code must include **at least** one instance of each of the following:

- pseudo-classes `:hover` and `:active`;
- pseudo-elements `::after` and `::before`;
- `display:grid` and `position:absolute`;
- a CSS animation.
  
<debug-info markdown="block">
ðŸ‘‰ A few pointers:

- CSS examples are plentiful on the web; you can adapt them to your own needs. Make sure though, that you **understand** the different CSS rules you are adding and are able to **explain** their effect. If in doubt, prefer simpler CSS rules, often the same effect can be achieved in a myriad of ways.
- If you are looking at [CSS examples from CodePen](https://codepen.io/) or similar platforms for inspiration, be aware of the fact that CSS extensions such as [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) exist. Do **not** use those, in this course we make use of *plain CSS*.
- If you want to center text vertically and horizontally within an element `el`, you can use the following CSS snippet to achieve this effect: `el { display: flex;  justify-content: center; align-items: center;}`. We do not introduce the [flexbox layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) in the lecture transcripts as there is only so much we can cover. There is thus no need to use it. If you want to center some text though (which before the introduction of flexbox was a real pain!), this snippet will make it easy.
</debug-info>

### 1.2)

Next, tackle the CSS for your **game screen**. The look of the game screen should be coherent with the splash screen. The two are likely to share basic CSS settings (colors, fonts, etc.); try to be efficient and do not duplicate existing CSS code. 

Your code for the game screen must have at least one instance of each of the requirements listed in 1.1).

<debug-info markdown="block">
In a board game, you may want to assign elements (tiles, cards, etc.) a different status depending on player actions, e.g. a game token moves from tile A to B. An effective manner to achieve this is to assign different CSS classes depending on a tile's state. In JavaScript, `document.getElementById(id).className += " anotherClass";` adds a CSS `class` to an element.
</debug-info>


### 1.3)

To ensure that your players are aware of the screen size limitations (i.e. the game works well on a larger screen), use [media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) to **alert players** if their screen resolution is below a sufficiently large minimum. How exactly the alert looks like is up to you. What exactly the screen resolution minimum is, is up to you. There is no need to actually try your app on different physical devices, Firefox (other major browsers have similar tooling) has a [Responsive Design Mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Responsive_Design_Mode) tool that provides good simulations of various devices.

### 1.4)

Once you have completed the CSS of your app, head over to the Brightspace forum and find the thread you posted your initial wireframe designs in. Add your implemented design screenshots to the same thread. *Does your implementation deviate significantly from your initial design?* If so, write a paragraph comparing the two.

*Feel free to browse your colleagues' designs and implementations and comment on them!*

## 2. Templating

When you started out and generated the boilerplate code, we asked you to set as *view engine* `ejs`. Let us now make use of that view engine for the **splash screen**. If you followed our assignment instructions, so far, not a lot is going on with it; it should visually look appealing and have a *Play* button, but that's about it.

One last requirement for the splash screen is to show three statistics such as number of games played, number of games ongling, etc. (what exactly to display is up to you). Templates offer us a way to *inject* those numbers into our splash screen.

There are many view engines available, `ejs` is one of the more common ones. What we have to do now is to create a `splash.ejs` file in folder `myapp/views/` as this folder is the default one the view engine is looking for content. Initially, `splash.ejs` is a copy of your `splash.html` file. Add a few template tags for the game statistics in the right place. If you are unsure what exactly to do, take a look at our demo game's [splash.ejs](https://github.com/chauff/balloons-game/blob/master/views/splash.ejs) file. Then, rewrite a few lines of `app.js` to incorporate the view engine and alter the route to `/`; it should now use the `res.render` call. This code snippet can help you:

```javascript
//code snippet, not a complete piece of code!
const app = express();
...
//only the route to / needs to be changed
app.set('view engine', 'ejs')
app.get('/', function(req, res) {
    //example of data to render; here gameStatus is an object holding this information
    res.render('splash.ejs', { gamesInitialized: gameStatus.gamesInitialized, gamesCompleted: gameStatus.gamesCompleted });
})
```

*Note: in the lecture transcript we covered Ajax, which is an alternative approach to templating for our use case of presenting game statistics. Both technologies are relevant in practice.*

## 3. Cleaning up

Ensure that your app works as intended in two major browsers.

Ensure that your code contains the necessary `package.json` file content to install/run the code, i.e. it should be sufficient to take your `myapp` folder, and run `npm install` and `npm start` to start the server. Any specific configuration parameters your code requires should be described in an accompanying `README` file.

ðŸŽ†ðŸŽ†ðŸŽ†ðŸŽ†ðŸŽ† **Well done!** If you have reached this point, you have a fully functioning game.

You now have three options:

- Be glad you made it and call it a day!
- Deploy your game on a publicly accessible server and let others play it!
- Make a screencast showing off your game!

## 4. Optional: game deployment / video

### Short-term deployment

To make your game accessible to the public, it needs to be deployed somewhere&mdash;`locahost:3000` only goes so far.

For short-term deployments (a few minutes/hours), e.g. to show off your game quickly, [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) is a good solution. You can run your server on localhost and expose it through a public URL. *Please do **NOT** run any privacy-sensitive apps this way, as all traffic passes through ngrok servers!*

### Longer-term deployment

ngrok is not a solution for an actual deployment. [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) (among other platforms) is. Heroku is a cloud platform that has a free account tier, suitable for web applications without a lot of traffic. You can deploy a Node.js application following their [instructions](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs).

### Make a screencast

As an alternative, make a screencast of your game and upload it to a video hosting platform such as [vimeo](https://vimeo.com/upload) or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/).

Once you have deployed or recorded your app, head over to your thread on Brightspace which already contains your game design and game screenshots and post the URL to the game or the screencast. Take a look at what your fellow study colleagues produced and comment away.
