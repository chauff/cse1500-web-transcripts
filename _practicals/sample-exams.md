**Exam topics are all topics covered in the lectures and the required readings.** The content of the recommended activities/readings that goes beyond what is covered in the lectures/course book is not exam material.

The web technology exam usually contains about 40 multiple-choice questions; the resit is shorter with about 30 questions (due to the time constraints of the resit week).
